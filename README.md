# Data_Mining_Assignment
This repository contains all .ipynb, .py, .sh and .csv files regarding one assignment of my Data Mining (CS685A) course work.<br>
Here in this repository, all used datasets which are downloaded from given portal are in 'Used CSV files' folder; all .ipynb files are in 'IPYNB files' folder, all .py files are in '.py files' folder, .sh files in '.sh files' folder and result CVs (csv created as output of question) are in 'Result CSVs' folder.<br>
<br>
<br>

Here python scripts (.py scripts) are embedded in corresponding bash scripts (.bh scripts).<br>
<br>


You can follow thesesteps if you want to use .sh scripts.<br>
<br>

1. Put all .py and .sh files along with .csv files (which are downloaded from given portal) in a folder, say 'test_folder'.<br>

2. Open git bash.<br>

3. Change the path to the newly created 'test_folder' folder (told in Step-1).<br>

4. Install numpy , pandas and openpyxl.<br>
    Write:<br>
     pip install numpy<br>
    Run it.<br>
    Write:<br>
     pip install pandas<br>
    Run it.<br>
    Write:<br>
     pip install openpyxl<br>
    Run it.<br>
   
5. Write :<br>
       chmod +x file.py<br>
   (replace the word 'file' in the last command by corresponding .py file name)<br>
   Run it.<br>

6. Write:<br>
      ./file.sh<br>
      (replace the word 'file' in the last command by corresponding .py file name)<br>
   Now you will get the corresponding csv files (which are asked in the questions to get and prsent in 'Result CSVs' folder) in your folder.<br>

7. There is a requirements.txt file attched.
